# Problems

## 1. Download and Install SPIN (10 points)

Download and install SPIN. Create a screen shot showing it working on the machine. See [Spin](https://wiki.cs.byu.edu/cs-486/tools) for help.

## 2. Prove Mutual Exclusion (30 points)

Model the following mutual exclusion algorithm with Promela (25 points) and prove is *correctness* or *incorrectness* with SPIN (5 points).

## 3. Farmer Crosses River (30 points)

Write a Promela model for the below problem (25 points) and use SPIN to find a solution (5 points). The model should use a channel to represent the boat sending to move from one side of the river to the other.

*A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. There is a boat that can fit himself plus either the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage. If the wolf and the goat are alone on one shore, the wolf will eat the goat. If the goat and the cabbage are alone on the shore, the goat will eat the cabbage. How can the farmer bring the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river?*

## 4. Elevator Design (30 points)

This problem is Exercise 5.5 in Principles of Model Checking (page 321). Consider an elevator system that services `N > 0` floors numbered `0` through `N-1`. There is an elevator door at each floor with a call-button and an indicator light that signals whether or not the elevator has been called. The system must have the following properties:

  1. Any door on any floor is never open when the elevator is not present
  2. A requested floor will be served eventually
  3. The elevator repeatedly returns to floor 0
  4. When the top floor is requested, the elevator serves it immediately and does not stop on any floor on the way up

**Part 1** (4 points) Identify which properties relate to *safety* and which properties relate to *liveness*.

**Part 2** (12 points) Create a Promela model for the elevator. 

**Part 3** (12 points) Add assertions to prove the safety properties hold in the model.
